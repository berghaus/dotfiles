====================

Each branch corresponds with a different machine, typically also different
operation system. The defaul one is OS X.

## Installation
The `bootstrap.sh` script will do the magic for you. For more info.
`bootstrap.sh -h`.

## Misc
A real programmer should think about remapping caps-lock to escape with
[Seil](https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/seil.html) - The escape key
is the single most used key in vim.

Yes I use iTerm2 not OS X Terminal, you should do the same :-)

* Set up a system wide hotkey for iTerm2 (Keys=>Hotkey).
  Recommended Cmd-Escape, which is really Cmd-Capslock.
